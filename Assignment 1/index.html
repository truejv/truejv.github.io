<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Javeyon Vaughn. I am a junior computer science major from Burlington North Carolina. I have yet to decide
 between cyber security and machine learning as my concentration. My hobbies include gaming, weight lifting, piano and 
 acoustic guitar. I have been learning guitar for over a year and piano for less than half a year. I am self-taught in 
both. My favorite game genres are fighting games and survival games.</p>
